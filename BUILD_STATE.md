# OTA Hub Antenna Toolkit — Build State

**Single source of truth for scheduled resume runs.** Read this first, update it last.

- Project root: `/Users/macbookair/Desktop/Antenna Design App`
- Python: `/Users/macbookair/miniconda3/bin/python` (numpy 2.2.6, scipy 1.16.3, matplotlib 3.10.8)
- Build order chosen by user: **breadth of archetypes first** (CLI only in S1; GUI in S3)
- Disk: ~30 GB free as of 2026-09-13 20:30. The earlier 3.4 GB squeeze has cleared,
  so PySide6 is no longer a risk.

## Session plan — SCHEDULE HAS SLIPPED, READ THIS

S1 consumed both the interactive session and scheduled run 1 and 2, because every
spec-writing subagent died: 16 agent launches across three token windows produced
one usable file. The specs were ultimately written directly in the main loop, which
worked. **Do not delegate spec authoring to subagents.**

| # | Scope | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| S1 | Core engine, registry, 40 archetypes, CLI, tests | **DONE** (2026-09-13 22:30) |
| S2 | Waveguides module + arrays (layouts, tapers, array factor) | **DONE** (2026-09-14) |
| S3 | PySide6 GUI shell: catalogue browser, param panel, plots | **DONE** (2026-09-14) |
| S4 | Exporters (CST VBA, HFSS script), matching/network utils | **DONE** (2026-09-14) |

The user typed `Continue` before the 01:12 run fired, and S2 was done in that
session. The 01:12 run, if it still fires, should pick up **S3 (GUI)**. S4
(exporters) remains outstanding after that.

## Invariants
- `otahub.core` must stay GUI-free and import-clean under plain numpy/scipy.
- Every archetype: declarative JSON in `specs/`, never Python.
- Every formula carries a `reference`, and every archetype at least one
  `known_cases` entry that becomes a live pytest case.
- Expectations of zero MUST use `tol_abs`; relative error is undefined there.
- Anything indicative rather than derived must say so in `notes`.

## Completed in S1
- `otahub/core/`: spec model, whitelisted AST evaluator (with Si/Ci/Bessel/elliptic),
  partial synthesis solver, registry, first-principles pattern maths.
- `otahub/cli/` + `OTA_Hub_AntennaToolkit.py` launcher: list / show / synth / check / doctor.
- 8 families, 40 archetypes: wire, loop, patch, horn, reflector, travelling_wave, uwb, slot.
- 241/241 known cases pass. Full suite green.

## Engine bugs found and fixed in S1
- All-or-nothing synthesis discarded whole designs over one unresolvable optional
  rule (79 of 100 known cases failed from this alone).
- Relative comparison against an expected zero reported a 3 ohm residual as 348% error.
- `db10()` used where a plain `log10()` fit was intended, inflating Yagi gain tenfold.
- `cosine_q` malformed expression; sidelobe finder mistook a second main beam for a sidelobe.

## Spec errors caught by the known-case harness
- quad_loop_square loss resistance out by 30.9x; halo_loop by 3.3x.
- Open-ended WR-90 gain 4.20 dBi, not 6.17. Ruze at 100 GHz 0.2057, not 0.2088.
- DRA radiation Q scales as eps_r^1.3 (2.46x per doubling), not 2x.
- Biconical Zc at 10 deg is 375.50 ohm, not 417.46.

## Completed in S2
- `otahub/waveguides/`: rectangular (modes, cutoff, guide wavelength, wave impedance,
  conductor and dielectric attenuation, power capacity, exact WR-series table),
  circular (Bessel-root cutoffs, TE01 low-loss mode), lines (coax, microstrip with
  exact-inverse synthesis, stripline, CPW, quarter-wave transformer).
- `otahub/arrays/`: uniform, binomial, Dolph-Chebyshev, Taylor n-bar and raised-cosine
  tapers; array factor, broadside directivity, beam steering, grating-lobe limits.
- CLI gained `guide`, `array` and `line` subcommands.
- Verified: WR-90 cutoff 6.557 GHz, attenuation 0.108 dB/m and power 1.05 MW all match
  datasheets; the 1.25x-1.90x band heuristic reproduces the published 8.2-12.4 GHz.
  Dolph-Chebyshev measured sidelobes equal the design level to 0.000 dB for every
  array size and level tested. Uniform d=lambda/2 directivity is exactly N.

## Bugs found in S2
- Dolph-Chebyshev even-length weights were independent of the design sidelobe level
  (missing half-sample phase term), and then rotated by one (ifft sign convention).
- `stripline_impedance` and `cpw_impedance` shipped dead `if False else` branches that
  double-applied the elliptic ratio. The limits settled the orientation: stripline
  needs K(k)/K(k'), CPW the inverse.
- WR table held rounded millimetres, perturbing WR-28's aspect to 1.997; now exact
  inch conversions.

## Corrections to my own assumptions in S2
- Not all WR guides are 2:1 - WR-90 is 2.25, WR-42 is 2.47.
- The WR number is hundredths of an inch, not mils, and is a ROUNDED nominal
  (WR-22 is really 0.224 in).
- Taylor is NOT more aperture-efficient than Dolph-Chebyshev for discrete arrays;
  measured, Chebyshev wins for n >= 20, consistent with its optimality proof.
  Taylor's real advantages are no edge spikes and decaying far sidelobes.

## Completed in S3
- PySide6 6.11.2 installed (~2 GB; 28 GB free remains).
- `otahub/gui/`: three tabs - Catalogue (tree + search + generated form + Design/Sweep/
  Pattern results), Arrays (live taper designer), Waveguides (WR calculator with a
  dispersion plot). `otahub.core` remains GUI-free.
- The catalogue form is generated from each spec's declared parameters, so a new
  archetype in `specs/` gets a working UI with no GUI code change.
- `gui` subcommand added to the CLI and launcher.
- 40/40 archetypes verified to produce a non-empty design from form defaults.
- GUI tests run headless under QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen.

## Bugs found in S3
- Catalogue filter delegated family rows to the base class, whose empty regex accepts
  everything, so every family survived any search. Family rows must return False and
  be pulled back in by recursive filtering.
- Form opened with an empty f0 (no spec declares a typical for it), so synthesis
  produced zero geometry and looked broken. Frequency is now prefilled from the
  geometric mean of each archetype's validity band.
- Polar plots left the lower half blank; patterns here are azimuthally symmetric, so
  a blank half reads as a one-sided pattern. Now mirrored.

## Completed in S4
- `otahub/utils/`: network parameters (S/Z/Y/ABCD, cascading, line transforms) and
  matching (L-section, quarter-wave, single-stub). Pozar 5.1 and 5.2 reproduced exactly.
- `otahub/export/`: neutral geometry IR with two backends (CST VBA, HFSS IronPython).
  Builders for 7 archetypes; everything else exports parameters only and says so.
- CLI gained `export` and `match`.

## Bugs found in S4
- L-section used sqrt(Z0/RL) where Pozar 5.3a has sqrt(RL/Z0) -> matched to 181 ohm.
- I then flipped a sign in the other branch that was already correct; deriving it
  directly showed X and B take the SAME sign there.
- Parameter export guessed lengths from magnitude, writing 319 ohm as 319105 mm.
  Now driven by each spec's declared unit.
- DesignResult.get() could not see requirements; the engine did not record units for
  the lambda0 and k0 it derives itself. Both fixed.

## BUILD COMPLETE

All four sessions done. 40 archetypes, 8 families, 400 tests, 241/241 known cases.
See `docs/HANDOVER.md` for what is verified, what is not, and recommended next steps.

The largest untested surface: neither exporter has been run against a real CST or
HFSS installation. Structurally validated only.
